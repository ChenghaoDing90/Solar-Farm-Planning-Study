<ul>
      <li>Implemented a cost effectiveness study on the proposed solar farm with three different configurations (installation of standalone solar or battery storage, or a combination of solar and storage) </li>
      <li>Analyzed historical settlement point price in Houston in year 2019  </li>
      <li>Analyzed potential revenue streams from three suite of proposed projects, and found the most valuable time for the proposed installation of solar or storage </li>
