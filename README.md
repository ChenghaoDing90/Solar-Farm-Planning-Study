# Cost-Effectiveness Study on Solar Farm Planning

## Implemented a cost effectiveness study on the proposed solar farm with three different configurations (installation of standalone solar or battery storage, or a combination of solar and storage)
## Analyzed historical day-ahead energy price and real time energy price in New York city in year 2019
## Analyzed potential revenue streams from three suite of proposed projects, and found the most valuable time for the proposed installation of solar or storage
## Gave suggestions to how the energy price revenue streamed for each project would change over time, and gave the optimal solution to the solar farm project planning
