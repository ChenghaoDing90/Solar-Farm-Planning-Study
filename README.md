# Cost-Effectiveness Study on Solar Farm Planning

<ul>
      <li>Implemented a cost effectiveness study on the proposed solar farm with three different configurations (installation of standalone solar or battery storage, or a combination of solar and storage) </li>
      <li>Analyzed historical settlement point price in Houston in year 2019  </li>
      <li>Analyzed potential revenue streams from three suite of proposed projects, and found the most valuable time for the proposed installation of solar or storage </li>
  <li> Gave suggestions to how the energy price revenue streamed for each project would change over time, and gave the optimal solution to the solar farm project planning </li>
</ul>

Conclusions:

1) For standalone solar, the case study is close to cost effective, and the benefit will grow over time. Because the utility-scale system costs will decrease (according to EIA, NREL, Wood Mackenzieâ€¦), and the electricity price and demand will grow. This case only study the price taker model, if consider more condition as the tax saving and other potential benefit, it might include more benefit in the analysis.
2) For stand along storage, the benefit will grow over time. Since it has the potential to provide services that could reduce power system costs, and the installation cost will reduce.  Also, this model only calculate the energy arbitrage results, if consider the storage in other ancillary services, it might have more potential benefit. Storage can also replace traditional peaker plants,  and gain expected energy revenue and emission reduce benefit. 
3) For solar plus storage , the benefit will grow, cost for solar plus storage is less than install them along. Better dispatch algorithm can gain more benefit for storage and solar together, and the benefit will grow faster for both of them. However, this should only consider when both of them are cost effective.
4) I would not recommend any of them because my analysis finds that none of the three set up is cost-effective, under my assumptions. However, this result is based on the assumption that solar plant lifetime is 30 years, if the solar lifetime is more than 30 years, the stand along solar may be cost effective. In that case I would recommend the standalone solar setup.

Future Work
Follow up approach should include:
 1) Trend for cost on both solar and storage. 
In shorter time scale, include Covid-19 impacts, such as the increased overhead due to the increased warehousing cost, etc. 
In longer time scale, includes financial and performance impacts due to extreme weather.
2) Include more detailed parameters in the mathematical electricity dispatch model 
Model for solar should includes the OM costs and the Tax savings
Model for storage should include acetary services prices options
3) Potential saving research on policy
